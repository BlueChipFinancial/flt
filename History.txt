== 0.1.0 2009-06-19

* Initial release

== 0.2.0 2009-06-21

* New functions implemented:
  exp(), ln(), log10(), power().

== 0.2.1 2009-06-24

* Bug fixes:
  - Decimal#inspect was always producing debug information; now it uses $DEBUG
  - Raising some exceptions caused error, because too many parameters were being
    passed to the exception's base class initializer.

* New functionality:
  - ulp (unit in the last place)
  - normalize (in the classic sense, not in the original GDA sense)
  - maximum_finite, minimum_normal, minimum_nonzero value decimal constructors
  - epsilon, strict_epsilon, half_epsilon
  - setting context exponent limits with elimit
  - require decimal/shortcut to use D for Decimal
